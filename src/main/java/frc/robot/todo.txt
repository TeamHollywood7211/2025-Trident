wow VS code auto names this as a checklist thats cool

a. I named it Trident cuz it sounded cool and underwater-ish
b. There is no other reason

So far I just pulled all the useful stuff from the Kitbot code base. Heres a list of what needs to be done.


Pathplanner and swerve should be auto-integrated.

==Subsystems we need to make==

- Elevator subsystem (its cool)
- Limelight



Programming Rules:
    - We shall name variables smartly! (Except when we are rushing and type stupid names cuz we are mad) 
    - Variables* will be camelCased. Variable will be named like this "robotSpeed" or "leftIntakeStatus"
    - Functions shall NOT be named that and will just have a captital on every work, same with command/subsystem names.
    - Please remove comments from ExampleCommand and ExampleSubsystem when you use them, we need things to be clean (and easy to read)
    - However, please put comments on things to explain to others what they do!
    *that we make, not ones thrown in by CTRE Swerve, those we may change



Notes to understand for this bot (pseudo 2024-Astley/2025-KitBot post mordem (mortem?)):
    - .setDefaultCommand is how you schedule commands to constantly run (no more sketchy bad solutions like 2024-Astley that barely worked)
    - .applyRequest() is the function for the swerve object on how you tell it where to move
    - On a climber, DONT clamp at 0, or if you do have a button where it can refind its 0! That was a issue we ran into at ri3d that I had to quickly remove.
    - Theres like runOnce and run things that can make stuff really cool
    - DO NOT use InstantCommands in PathPlanner, it may look nicer but TRUST it suddenly bugged out and stopped working at ri3d (idk why!!!)
    - Java is stupid
    - You can use emojis in comments ðŸ¦Š
